    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here&apos;s the thing: I might be a little dramatic. I might use super-describers like magic and miracle and unbelievable to describe my favorite recipes. Regularly. This is all true.
    </p>
    <p>
    But when I say life-changing soft scrambled eggs? I literally mean life-changing.
    </p>
    <p>
    These eggs changed my life because &ndash; please withhold judgment &ndash; I used to NOT EAT SCRAMBLED EGGS. I know. I am not a picky eater, but scrambled eggs were one of a total of, like, three ingredients on my food black list.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>2 large free range eggs</li>
    6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk
    <li>a knob of butter</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li> Whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.</li>

    <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Don&apos;t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</li>


    <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.</li>

    <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>


    <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>

    <li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</li>

    </ol>
